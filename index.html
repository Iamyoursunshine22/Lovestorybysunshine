<h1>My Dearest [xpark]</h1>
<p>[i should be sitting on your lap kissing you instead of missing you. I know we might never get to meet again but i want you to know that, only if you gave us a chance from the start, maybe, just maybe you truly know me. I want to remind you of one thing, do not love because of family or friends, cause love sometimes fail, that's why most people breakup, but love for you and be selfish about it. I might not be her, but i wish i was but anyway. After reading, listen to "love story by indila" You're amazing and sweet, we can't be friends, cause i only want to be your lover. Love O]</p>
